HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It describes and defines the content of a webpage along with the basic layout of the webpage. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/ behavior (JavaScript).
"HyperText" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.
HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as <head>, <title>, <body>, <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <p>, <div>, <span>, <img>, <aside>, <audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, <embed>, <nav>, <output>, <progress>, <video> and many others.
Tags in HTML are case insensitive. That is, they can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. Example <title> tag can be written as <Title>,<TITLE> or in any other way.
  
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
CSS is one of the core languages of the open web and is standardized across browsers according to the W3C specification. Developed in levels, CSS1 is now obsolete, CSS2.1 is a recommendation, and CSS3, now split into smaller modules, is progressing on the standardization track.
