 -Create a webpage that has a full page image.
This image should always be shown "above the fold". What this means is that, regardless of the size of the browser viewport, the image always takes up the full viewport height. Any other content on the webpage will appear "below the fold".
Do not put content "below the fold" for this challenge.

-Using the webpage you created in the previous challenge, add a large piece of text in the center of the page on top of the image.

-Using the webpage you created in the previous challenge, add content "below the fold".

-Using the webpage you created in the previous challenge, add a header area to the top of the page which will remain fixed as we scroll the page.
This header area should be about 50 - 100 px in height.
In a future challenege, we will add content to this header area, but don't add content to it now.
You may need to refactor your code so that your HTML uses different elements in different areas.


-Using the webpage you created in the previous challenge, add two red boxes to the header area to the top of the page which remains fixed as we scroll the page.
Put one red box on the left and one on the right.
In a future challenege, we will add more content to this header area, but don't add any more content to it now.
